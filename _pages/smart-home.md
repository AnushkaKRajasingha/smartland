		<p>The term Smart Home has been a big buzzword thrown around by the media and tech companies everywhere, but what EXACTLY is a Smart Home? Home automation is the original concept where the term Smart Home comes from. Home automation can give you the ability and have remote control over things like climate, appliances, and even security systems.</p>

		<p>Recent popular Smart Home items include virtual assistants like Alexa or Google Home that can listen and respond to prompts, questions or commands and these virtual assistants even have a degree of control over other connected items. Home automation is a trend that continually grows in popularity as technology improves to increase and enhance our quality of living.</p>

		<p>Smart Homes have a myriad of benefits too (other than making you feel like James Bond). The biggest benefits that Smart Homes offer is to help you save money with things like smart thermostats. You can control your home’s climate from your phone and turn off heat or AC while you’re away, and turn them on just before you get home so you can come back to the perfect climate without running appliances all day.</p><p>Another big benefit is convenience. Having the power to control other devices or items around the house from a single controller is handy! It’s all in one place so you’ll never forget to use them when you need them or turn off something again.</p><p>Safety is another benefit you get from having a Smart Home. A lot of smart technology qualifies as giving you extra home security. Being able to control your locks remotely can ensure your home remains safe while you’re gone or ensures you’re safe when you’re there.</p>

		<p>Smartland properties is taking another front running stance when it comes to living better. Our residences provide a multitude of Smart Home technology features. Our properties contain built in Bluetooth speakers around the unit which you can connect to and play audio throughout the home. Party needs some music? Movie need surround sound? One press of the button and you have it at your fingertips!</p><p>Speakers aren’t the only thing you can control remotely from your Smartland Smart Home. Other automated features include smart locks and smart thermostats. You will always have peace of mind when you’re away so that that you know your home is safe, secure, and not wasting money! Climate control and security are two major concerns for everyone when it comes to better living and Smartland wants to guarantee anyone can live well.</p><p>Smartland home automation doesn’t just stop there! Some other notable inclusions we provide in our Smartland properties include USB outlets in every unit and in every room along with your very own virtual assistant, Alexa. We understand that some lose their cubes or charger bases to plug into an outlet. We also realize some chargers are sold without them or that people simply run out of them. Having USB outlets aren’t a necessary addition but a nice one and makes your Smart Home that much more convenient. Speaking of convenience, the Alexa inclusion on our properties tie everything together. Virtual assistants are an incredibly handy convenience and can connect and interact with your other smart tech which makes your Smart Home truly smart.</p><p>Don’t just live well. Live Smarter!</p>
