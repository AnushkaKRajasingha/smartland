		<p>Since our inception we have successfully maintained a variety of apartment buildings throughout Northeast Ohio that we personally own and manage. As seasoned apartment managers, we know what property management entails for our clients and that is why we are further expanding our portfolio to include apartments and large multi-unit properties whose owners could benefit from the extensive set of services we provide. Much of our success may be attributed to the fact that we recognize the importance of our responsibilities to tenants and owners alike.</p><p>With decades of experience in the Cleveland real estate market, the Smartland team has discovered the most successful approach to apartment management that is both comprehensive and cost efficient. Management fees for apartment premises include all of our full time management services and vary slightly based on the number of individual units in the complex and the property location.</p><p>At Smartland, we do what is necessary, when it is necessary- so you will never have to worry about dispensable charges related to your buildingâ€™s maintenance and upkeep. Our team of agents, contractors, and maintenance professionals are the best in their field- possessing the experience and knowledge necessary to provide quality work with impressive customer service in every area of property management.</p>
