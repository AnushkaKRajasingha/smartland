<h4>Everyone who rides a bike knows that it makes you feel good and is a great way to stay healthy.</h4>
Smartland is a huge supporter and a big fan of all kinds of healthy and environmentally conscious amenities. One important amenity that Smartland provides is the inclusion of secure bicycle stations on all of our apartment complex properties. We hope to get residents who already own bikes to ride them more frequently and maybe even encourage a few people to buy one! It is also another convenient security feature which is exclusive to all of our properties. Once a bike is locked in, it won’t be going anywhere. This helps make our properties just a little bit safer.

On top of having a place to park your cycle, a bike station also has tools included nearby to allow you to conveniently perform on-the spot repairs and maintenance for your bicycle. These tools include air pumps, wrenches, and other handy items for bike repair.

Not only is cycling a great reason to go a little greener and be a little more active, having bike stations on our properties also saves on valuable storage space. We understand how difficult it can be to store a bike in an apartment. With bike rack stations around the apartment complex, you won’t have to lug your bike up the stairs or wheel it every time down the halls into storage.

Storing your bike on a station stand also makes it more convenient to access! No more will you have to forgo your bike ride on a nice, beautiful day just because it’s a hassle to get it out and take out for a spin. And, if you have a flat tire, or your chain is loose, our handy tools will see your bike repaired quickly get you out the door in no time. Our bike stations are not just convenient for our tenants; they are also great and ready for use by your visitors. Many people either travel by bike or prefer to visit using a bike especially when the weather is nice. Being able to have an easy and secure place for visitors to leave and even fix their bikes when visiting our property is another amenity we offer. Bike riding is a healthy and environmentally beneficial endeavor that reaches even beyond our urban areas!

We at Smartland want to promote health in our communities. We firmly believe that a healthy community is a happy community. Encouraging bike use through the bike stations that we provide on our properties is a simple, convenient, non pushy way to communicate this belief. We want what’s best for our tenants. Providing bike stations was an obvious choice for some of our properties. The reason is because many of our residences are located in areas where an easy bike ride can get you where you need to go including Downtown Cleveland!

On top of convenience, bike stations are just one of the many security measures we provide to keep all our tenants safe. If Smartland can do it, we will always try to offer any amenity, big or small, to ensure that you and your property is always that much more secure. We don’t just stop there either. Bike stations are just one of the many environmentally conscious amenities that Smartland offers!
