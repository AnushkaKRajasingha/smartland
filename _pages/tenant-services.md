			<h4>Marketing</h4>		
		<p>We can get your vacancies tenanted or take over where you left off. In an effort to achieve full occupancy of our buildings, our management services also include a variety of multi-channel marketing efforts to reach as many prospective tenants as possible. Once we find a perfect match, tenants must be approved by meeting our qualifications for credit score, income, and rental history verification standards.</p>		
			<h4>Leasing</h4>		
		<p>Once the lease has been signed, tenant accounts are then created and added to our interactive management software that allows for communication with our team members and owners as well as online rent payments and maintenance requests.</p>
