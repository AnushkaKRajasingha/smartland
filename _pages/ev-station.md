		<p>EV Charging Stations, or, Electric Vehicle Charging Stations are parts of an infrastructure that supplies electric energy to recharge electric vehicles. As environmental consciousness and green movements become more prominent, one of the new responses to protect our ecology is the growing emergence and increasing presence of electric vehicles.</p>

		<p>Electric Vehicles, or, EVs run partly or completely on electricity. An EV can get much more mileage per gallon (or charge) than traditional gas vehicles. While the shift to EVs is still in its infancy, we see this shift as continuing to significantly increase and slowly take over the gas guzzlers. That’s why at Smartland we are beginning to install EV Charging Stations on our properties.</p>

		<p>As time passes and EVs become more relevant in the public eye, these vehicles are becoming more and more consumer friendly. (Their prices are dropping!) The more types of models that come out and the less expensive current models become in the near future will eventually lead to an overall shift in consumer vehicle purchasing. In the long run, purchasing an EV will be cheaper overall than a traditional gas vehicle based on fuel efficiency.</p><p>More and more people are buying EVs and Smartland’s Properties are ready for them! Having an EV Charging Stations literally on our doorstep is good to have for anyone who needs a quick charge and can encourage others to buy an EV. Having an EV Charging Stations is a step closer to a greener living community.</p>

		<p>Smartland is Cleveland’s first real estate company to introduce EV stations on its apartment properties. Not only are we making life easier for tenants, we hope to be starting a growing trend throughout all of the Cleveland area. Having EV Charging Stations in more places, especially places of residence, can encourage and foster a more environmentally aware Cleveland.</p><p>Not only are our charging stations for use by our tenants but they are also open to public use. Anyone can stop in and charge their vehicle. We have 2 prime locations - one being just outside Downtown Cleveland and also right off of I-90.</p><p>We see the changing shift and we are thrilled to be on the cusp of a great and healthy movement that will improve the quality of life for people and help protect our environment for the coming future!</p>
