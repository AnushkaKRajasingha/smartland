<h3>A place for Pets</h3>		
			<h3>Pet Friendly</h3>		
		<p>“Pet Friendly” is a term to describe a place that is either suitable for pets, or accepts pets while you stay there. At Smartland Properties we prefer a better term which we like to call “Pet Prosperous”. Not only are most types of pets allowable in our properties, but we especially like to welcome them and even encourage pet ownership! We know and understand they’re not just your pet; they become a part of your family. We completely understand just how important pets are to you when it comes to living a more fulfilling life and we support pets fully.</p>

		<p>However, “Pet Friendly” doesn’t necessarily mean we can give free reign to every type of pet. We’d love to accommodate every possible pet but there are other issues we have to take into consideration like safety regulations and certain legalities. For a full list of the types of pets we can allow, look here: *BIG OL LINK FOR RESTRICTIONS*. Our units are also specifically designed with pets in mind. We take special care and effort to make sure that both you and your furry, scaly, or feathered friends are comfortable in your new home.</p><p>Everyone knows that people are generally happier when they have a pet at home. Not only are pets great companions but having a pet can also lead to a more active and social lifestyle. It’s not hard to get to know and socialize with your neighbors when they are outside and playing with their pets. You can also share a common interest that’s easy to talk about. Socializing is not only important for our human residents that we house either! Pets are not only able but need to interact with other pets or people because such a simple activity can be just as an enjoyable an experience for them.</p><p>We already know all the good that pets can do for individuals, but we have seen for ourselves what they can do for a community. Smartland prefers to let our tenants live how they want and always be happy with their living conditions. Being a pet friendly community is an extension of this belief that we so strongly believe in. We don’t like separating people from their pets and want to give others the opportunity to get a pet if they want to. Pet friendliness makes for a happier, healthier living community.</p><p>When it comes to being pet friendly, Smartland is the top dog! Not only are ALL of Smartland’s apartment units and rental properties pet friendly, we designed our units with pets in mind. We went above and beyond to accommodate our four legged friends by including the building of pet parks on our properties. The pet park at our Breakwater Tower Apartment Complex is the largest pet park in Cuyahoga County.</p>

The pet park at our Breakwater Tower Apartment Complex is the largest pet park in Cuyahoga County.</p><p>We made our properties pet friendly because we include resilient flooring made from the toughest material. Our flooring still looks elegant but it can also handle the wear and tear of your active pets. We’re confident our units can handle any pet mess or mischief. Alongside our properties we also include convenient and handy clean up supplies for any messes when you take your pet outside.</p><p>With over a decade in this business, one thing has remained consistent: every single one of our properties is pet friendly. So, here at all of our Smartland properties, we strive to make sure you and all your family members, (furry or otherwise) are comfortable, happy, and most importantly that you always stay together.</p>
